# Face-recognition
This code was developed during the Python 3 Programming Specialization offered by the University of Michigan through Coursera. 

In this project we used a set of newspapers to identify faces associated with specific names. I used OpenCV to detect faces, 
tesseract to do optical character recognition, and PIL to composite images together into contact sheets.

This code was tested using a set of small images. Therefore is subject to certain limitations.
